# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
  * I feel very confident about using built-in methods.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
  * I feel good about creating my own methods that act on integers. I do not feel as confident about using my own  methods that act on strings.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
  * Can you define variables within a method that you create? How do you do this?
